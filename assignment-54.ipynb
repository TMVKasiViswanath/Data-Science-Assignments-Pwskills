    "Euclidean Distance: Works well with data where the relationship between features is continuous and evenly distributed. It assumes isotropic data distribution.\n",

    "Impact on Outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean Distance: More sensitive to outliers because it squares the differences, amplifying their effect on the distance calculation.\n",
