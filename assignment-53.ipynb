    "Distance Measure Becomes Less Informative:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: In high-dimensional spaces, the distances between points become less distinguishable. Most points tend to be approximately equidistant from each other.\n",
    "Impact: KNN relies on distance metrics (like Euclidean distance) to identify nearest neighbors. When distances are similar, it becomes difficult to identify truly nearest neighbors, leading to poor classification or regression performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Problem: The time and computational resources required to calculate distances between points grow significantly with the number of dimensions.\n",
    "Impact: High-dimensional data can lead to slower training and prediction times, making KNN computationally expensive and less practical for large datasets.\n",
    "Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: With more dimensions, the model can become overly complex and sensitive to noise in the training data.\n",
    "Impact: KNN might fit the training data too closely, capturing noise as if it were a significant pattern, which reduces its generalization ability to new, unseen data.\n",
    "Sparsity of Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: As the number of dimensions increases, the volume of the space increases exponentially, making the data points sparse.\n",
    "Impact: The sparsity means that data points are far from each other, and each point has fewer neighbors, reducing the effectiveness of the KNN algorithm which relies on local neighborhoods."
