    "A Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method for regression tasks that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the average prediction of the individual trees. Here are the key points:\n",

    "Ensemble Averaging: By averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees, random forests reduce the variance of the model. While individual trees might overfit to the noise in the training data, averaging their predictions smooths out these irregularities.\n",
