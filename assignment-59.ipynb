    "Approach: These methods partition the data into \n",

    "k clusters, where \n",
    "ùëò\n",
    "k is a predefined number. They attempt to minimize the distance between points within a cluster and maximize the distance between points in different clusters.\n",
    "Assumptions: The number of clusters \n",
    "ùëò\n",
    "k is known in advance. Clusters are spherical and equally sized.\n",
    "2. Hierarchical Methods\n",
    "Examples: Agglomerative (Bottom-Up), Divisive (Top-Down)\n",
    "Approach: These methods create a hierarchy of clusters that can be visualized using a dendrogram. Agglomerative clustering starts with individual points as clusters and merges them, while divisive clustering starts with one cluster and splits it.\n",
