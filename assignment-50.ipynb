    "A Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method for regression tasks that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the average prediction of the individual trees. Here are the key points:\n",

    "Ensemble Method: Combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting.\n",
    "Bootstrapping: Each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data (with replacement).\n",
    "Feature Randomness: At each split in a tree, a random subset of features is considered for splitting, enhancing diversity among trees.\n",

    "Ensemble Averaging: By averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees, random forests reduce the variance of the model. While individual trees might overfit to the noise in the training data, averaging their predictions smooths out these irregularities.\n",

    "Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging): Each decision tree is trained on a different random subset of the training data. This reduces the likelihood that the trees will overfit to any particular portion of the data, as each tree sees a different dataset.\n",

    "Random Feature Selection: At each split in the trees, a random subset of features is considered. This ensures that the trees are less correlated, as different trees will consider different splits, reducing the risk that all trees will overfit in the same way.\n",
