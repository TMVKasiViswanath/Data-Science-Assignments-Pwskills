    "An activation function in artificial neural networks is a mathematical function applied to the output of each neuron (or unit) in a neural network. It determines whether a neuron should be activated (i.e., fire) based on the weighted sum of its inputs. Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data.\n",

    "\"Leaky ReLU\" is a variant of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which is commonly used in neural networks.
