    "Boosting is an ensemble technique in machine learning that aims to improve the accuracy of predictions by combining the outputs of multiple weak learners to create a strong learner. The idea behind boosting is to sequentially train models, each one correcting the errors of its predecessor. This method focuses on the samples that previous models classified incorrectly, thereby improving the overall performance."
